* core-image-v2x-dev::
This image contains all the necessary components for giving 802.11p connectivity. Up until now, it is only provided a development
image, this means that Wireless-regdb and CRDA software have to been compiled in the host (Hummingboard2).

connection without compiling those programs in the host.
